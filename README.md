### Planning Phase:
- create a child's game using some of Simon's rules
- create a random function for the pattern that would display 2 numbers and then increse as the player does better
- create function to record what button is being pressed and that it matches the pattern
- have a way to let user know that the button was clicked (color change, sound, opacity change, etc..)
- create a function to keep score and determine when the player has won the game.
- animation for a win situation.
- used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery on this project

### How it works:
- the game starts with a random pattern displayed on the botttom which has five numbers.
- user must click on the pattern correctly to move on. (works only with mouse)
- if user passes the first round the pattern will increase by one more number.
- if user fails to follow the pattern they will fail and have a chance to try again.
- there is no timer as this is a child game.


### Purpose of game 
- a fun way for kids to learn
- education game for preschoolers to start recognizing numbers
- help kids become used to computers and how it works


###User Story
- as a teacher/ user  I want to be able to use this game online. Have a fun way for the kids to learn their numbers in small increments
   have ways they can interact with the game (have them know when they won and when they fail as welll as have control to continue and 
   replay if needed)
